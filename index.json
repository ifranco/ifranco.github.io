Its tangible interface is constituted by an array of five channels, each composed of an extremely accurate thumb joystick, potentiometers and buttons. The layout follows the morphology of the hand, with each finger resting on top of one joystick, providing extreme gestural amplification of the hand where small movements can have significant impact.\nWe chose to explore the ambient and drone style through a 5-channel granular synthesis. Sounds can be freely assigned to each channel and joysticks are mapped to amplitude and sample read position, requiring continuous energy input from the player to reach morphing sustaining sounds.\nIn turn the potentiometers control grain density, pitch and gain. Interesting performative behaviors emerge from the mechanical and physiological constraints implicit by the design and through gestures like opening, closing, translating or rotating.\n         ","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"d1c4c73a1e3db0d3fe76e121befdd3ff","permalink":"https://ifranco.github.io/project/the-mitt/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/the-mitt/","section":"project","summary":"“The Mitt” is a digital synthesizer that explores the fine motor skills of the human hand and the performative aspects of micro gestures.","tags":["art"],"title":"The Mitt","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ivan Franco"],"categories":["technology"],"content":"The Vibropixels are self-contained haptic devices, composed of two vibrotactile actuators, four RGB LEDs and a battery.

An hybrid of music, performance and installation, depicting the process of human mental activity and its decomposition into the simple synaptic events of the brain.\nThe audience enters a room to find a woman sitting on a chair. From her hair several strings protrude and connect to piezoelectric sensors. The plucking of the strings generates voltage spikes on the sensor array that sends these electrical pulses to the computer, while a program written in Supercollider reinterprets this data and shapes it into sonic structures. This process resembles its biological counterpart at the neural level.\nThe result is a peek into the soul of this lady character, as the audience is invited to play the instrument and create a soundscape composed of music and also the inner voices of this woman’s reasoning. Through this digital aesthetic artists Ivan Franco and Lígia Teixeira explore the recreation of the process of neural transmission in the brain and how this biological process evolves into the complexity of consciousness.\n  Strings of Thought 2 @ Harvestworks(NY 2013)          Credits Artistic Direction, Performance: Ivan Franco and Lígia Teixeira\nConcept: Lígia Teixeira\nSound, Programming, Electronics: Ivan Franco\nText: Liza Wade Green\nAcknowledgments A MILLIWAYS production, in partnership with Harvestworks(NY).\n","date":1370044800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1370044800,"objectID":"2b28343fe4450a88a107240e7732614f","permalink":"https://ifranco.github.io/project/strings-of-thought-2/","publishdate":"2013-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/strings-of-thought-2/","section":"project","summary":"Strings of Thought 2 is an interactive installation that invites interaction with a performer through a wearable meta-instrument to create a collaborative soundscape.","tags":["art"],"title":"Strings of Thought 2","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Contact is both an interactive installation and a performance of electronic music.

Conceptually, the project intends to evoke human self-reflection and its consequence on the decision-making process. This introspection also questions the duality of who we are and who we wish to be.\n   In the performance, this argumentation is materialized through a scenic setup of suspended cables attached to various points of the dancer\u0026rsquo;s body. They represent the abstractions of our personal dogmas, conditioning movement and dexterity. These cables have particular physical responses, working similarly to a car seatbelt - they can extend/retract and have a braking system, so that acceleration over a certain threshold will block the body\u0026rsquo;s movement.\n   The cables were installed with a set of embedded sensors that measure linear movement and weight, generating data to digitally control light and sound. This interactive system operates in realtime, allowing the choreography to become the motor for all the music and stage effects.\n  Official info  Milliways Credits Artistic direction: Ivan Franco and Lígia Teixeira\nChoreography, Dance: Lígia Teixeira\nMusic, Sound design: Ivan Franco\nLighting design: David Palma, Danny Green\nOriginal text, Voice over: Liza Wade Green\nArtistic advisory: David Grubbs /PIMA MFA\nTechnical system supervision: António Caetano Monteiro, Pedro Branco, Nelson Zagalo, Minho University\nInteractive and Technical system construction: António Caetano Monteiro, Pedro Ramôa, Vítor Faria, Vítor Neto (UM Mechanics Department) and Ivan Franco.\nAcknowledgments A MILLIWAYS co-production with Guimarães 2012 European Capital of Culture.\nIn partnership with 3LD Art + Technology Center and Minho University.\nThis project was financed by the Portuguese State Secretary of Culture / DGArtes.\n","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"96ee11eec8a4cf80841eba57306a0118","permalink":"https://ifranco.github.io/project/strings-of-thought/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/strings-of-thought/","section":"project","summary":"Strings of Thought is a contemporary dance piece where the dancer controls light and sound through a set of suspended cables.","tags":["art"],"title":"Strings of Thought","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ll be playing at the In/Out Fest next Saturday.

They were always too dependent on environmental conditioning (like light) or two slow or imprecise. Usually I’ve tried out using 320x240 video matrixes, with CPU based blob detection and so. These systems never fully satisfied me and that’s why the Airstick is based on physical IR optical rangers, with much more responsive rates. Nevertheless the Airstick also has it’s own restrictions, the biggest being the lower resolution of the x-axis, which results of the horizontal sensor array distribution.\nA month or so ago I saw an experiment of Johnny Lee , from the HCI group at the Carnegie Mellon University. He’s been doing interesting experiments with the Wiimote and he explained how the tracking system for the Wiimote works. Basically it has on-board blob detection of up to four IR points at a resolution of 1024x768. This makes it much more precise than the typical webcam approach and the hardware blob calculation is much faster than the CPU correspondent.\nThis turned me into experimenting with this and I ended up building these small IR led fingers that I point at the Wiimote. With two leds in each hand I can control two different 3D objects, with position (x,y), angle rotation and size.\n   It’s looking good and I think I’ll try to incorporate these into my next performance to happen on the 18th January, in Lisbon. Soon I\u0026rsquo;ll post a You Tube video of a demo.\nLastly thanks to the STEIM crew for having me. They create the perfect environment for this type of experimentation.

This time around we concentrated essentially on theoretical thinking about performing with new media. A very good exercise was to build some mind maps and find out about the different issues that each one of us is concerned about.\nOne word that sticked to my mind was “fragility”. Is fragility what makes us interested in performance per se? Knowing that the performer is expressing his own thoughts and ideas into an improvisational scenario and that it can all just go wrong.\nOf course it is easy to point that it could simply go wrong (or be bad) because the performer is not good enough, but we must also consider that the digital system itself is prone to misbehavior. The digital media should, in theoretical terms, be immune to error or failure, since machines should always behave the same, with certainty to them. Thus it should be controllable by definition, which doesn’t really happen.\nI think it doesn’t happen because we’ve connected two worlds: digital and biological. The variability of the biological environment is automatically mapped onto the digital system and thus it becomes much more evident to us, performers, that we live in an environment full of chaotic functions, very distant from the digital precision. This is very visible if you simply take any analog sensor and connect it to some kind of digitizing device. Any sensor has noise to it. The digital values jump up and down. Our biological environment does so too.\nRegarding the performer side, this indeterminacy adds up to the fact that we are makers and performers. By building our own instruments we must then learn how to use them. This is already a big step. An even bigger step is learning something that doesn\u0026rsquo;t always behave equally. And that makes it interesting! If we ever got to the totally deterministic response, maybe even us, performers, would loose some interest into exploring this media’s “experimental possibilities”.\nBut that leads to other issues, namely one that really strikes me as very important: Who is restricting who? (if the word “restriction” is applicable). Are we controlling machines and making them the instruments of our precise vocabulary or are they just restricting our creativity, blurring our expression?\nAre we adapting to the machine’s behavior or is it adapted and designed around our own purposes?\nThese are very basic questions which I’m sure many of the researchers of this field have already addressed, but it is very good to see some of this discussion emerge in our own group.\nWe’ll keep commenting on these. Soon Teresa will have our mindmaps freshly distributed. I need to take another look at those! :-)\n","date":1198454400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1198454400,"objectID":"54cfa175a587e55a15b05f81bb70bc86","permalink":"https://ifranco.github.io/post/the-winter-nip-session-outcomes/","publishdate":"2007-12-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/the-winter-nip-session-outcomes/","section":"post","summary":"Again the N.I.P. crew was together at STEIM (Amsterdam).

It’s about the relationship between a woman and her imaginary companion. The woman lives between two spaces: bed and concrete reality.\nPlaced on the bed is a full sized aquarium, representing the woman’s dream-space. The man’s image lives bi-dimensionally both on the bed and the aquarium’s side. They interact in a love dance and are participants in the woman’s shift between the two worlds of dream and reality, from passion to disillusion.\nThe Performance:\n“Algum Dia Tinha de Ser a Sério” is a dance performance which represents the love relationship between a woman and an imaginary man, by staging the telematic contact between the two. In a room, where a bed bridges between real and imaginary, the lovers inhabit different dimensions: while the tridimensional woman is inside the aquarium, the bi-dimensional man is on the bed.\nTechnically the telematic experience is accomplished by using two synchronized projections of the man on the bed, captured in realtime in an alternate room, where the dancer is filmed. He also has reference video monitors, which allow him to see the stage action. The woman is inside a full water tank, placed over the bed, where the two projections (vertical and horizontal) are applied on the bed’s surface and on the back face of the aquarium. Image projection over the tank’s translucent surface is possible by using a special transparent film, which induces the illusion of a holographic video image.\nThe feminine character is also confronted with a third space: the outside world. It reveals the harsh confrontation with the “concréte” quotidian, a world apart from the room, the dream’s private space, able to induce the illusion for the imaginary lover. The traveling between these two worlds is symbolized by a lamp, switched on and off by the dancer, transporting her from one world to the other.\n         Credits Artistic Direction: Ivan Franco and Lígia Teixeira\nChoreography: Lígia Teixeira\nInterpretation: Lígia Teixeira and David Marques\nMusic: Ivan Franco e André Nascimento\nLight Design: André Almeida\nProgramming: Gonçalo Lopes, André Almeida and Ivan Franco\nTechnical Assistance: Coias\nAcknowledgments Centro Cultural de Belém\n","date":1152316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1152316800,"objectID":"4ba0da3c2445f31aff00a1d73366466c","permalink":"https://ifranco.github.io/project/algum-dia/","publishdate":"2006-07-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/algum-dia/","section":"project","summary":"Algum Dia Tinha De Ser A Sério is a dance piece about the relationship between a woman and the imaginary companion of her dreams.","tags":["art"],"title":"Algum Dia Tinha de Ser a Sério","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ivan Franco"],"categories":["YDreams"],"content":"In 2007 YDreams created an augmented reality ad for the Dove soap brand that allowed moviegoers to play with bubbles on the big screen.\n   Dove\u0026rsquo;s interactive ad in the cinema.

Since the beginning of the company we had a clear vision of the possibilities of AR, inspired by the early work of people like Steven Feiner and the experiments on synthetic image of our own co-founder Edmundo Nobre. In 2005 we were creating our first experiments on 3D projected AR, featuring space mapping to enable occlusions and shadow casting. We also dynamically mapped real objects, creating realtime physics models so they could interact with digital objects.\n    A virtual character strolling through our office.      Realsim: a real and a virtual car interacting on the same environment, with occlusions and collisions.   Later we started experimenting with human input interaction and the possibilities people becoming actors inside the AR simulation.    Our collaborator Antão Almada, playing with virtual water and bubbles.   Around 2008 we had built a product called virtual sightseeing, an AR kiosk that displayed a layer of information over the scenery of tourist attraction sites. This kiosk turned 360 degrees and contained a touch screen, motorized cameras with zoom/tilt and a GSM data connection.\n   Virtual Sightseeing: an AR kiosk for touristic viewpoints.   In 2009 we were already established in a rising AR market, which allowed us to create several new products and collaborate with many companies around the world. Two of those partners were Canesta and Primesense, both Silicon Valley startups focused the development of depth sensing technologies. In partnership with these companies we created groundbreaking AR concept applications. With depth sensing, AR simulations could become much more accurate, opening the doors for much more complex and rewarding interactions. Both Canesta and Primesense were later bought by Microsoft to create the Kinect controller for the Xbox.\n   Antão\u0026rsquo;s fine interaction with a green elastic blob.
